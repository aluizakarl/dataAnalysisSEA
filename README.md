# Applications of the Soybean Expression Atlas in Genomics and Transcriptomics Research

This repository is part of the chapter titled **"Applications of the Soybean Expression Atlas in Genomics and Transcriptomics Research"**, 
which explores the use of the soybean expression atlas in genomics and transcriptomics studies. 
The chapter provides an in-depth overview of how to use transcriptomic data from Soybean Expression Atlas
(https://soyatlas.venanciogroup.uenf.br/) to understand the molecular mechanisms behind important traits in soybean, such as stress tolerance and disease resistance.

## Contents

This repository includes the following:

- **Data:** Raw data and processed datasets used in the analysis, including RNA-seq and Genomic Association Studies(GWAS) data and related metadata.
- **Scripts:** R and Python scripts used to process and analyze the soybean transcriptomic data.
- **Analysis Results:** Results of analyses, such as differential expression, co-expression networks and gene ontology enrichment.
- **Figures:** Visualizations such as heatmaps, volcano plots, and gene expression comparisons.
